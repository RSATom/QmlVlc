QmlVlc
======

libvlc wrapper for Qt Quick 2/Qml.

Requires Qt 5.x.<br>
Platform independent, and should work on any platform supported by Qt and Vlc ( but was tested only on Windows and Ubuntu Linux ).

Simple usage demo is available: [QmlVlcDemo](https://github.com/RSATom/QmlVlcDemo)

Uses almost the same api as [FBVLC](http://code.google.com/p/fbvlc/wiki/FBVLC_API?ts=1396926615&updated=FBVLC_API) uses.
